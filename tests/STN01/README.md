## Validation criteria

:zap: For this test case to be considered passed, **all criteria listed in this section**, and **the ones of prerequisites tests** shall be verified. :zap:

### Formal rules

#### IFC standard (schema and specification)

When validated using the bSI Validation Service, the IFC must pass:
- Syntax & Schema check
- All following rules:
  - ALB002 - Alignment layout (RI-6)
  - ALB003 - Alignment directions
  - TBD000 - Alignment shape representation (RI-5, RI-9, RI-10, RI-12, RI-14)
  - TBD000 - Stationing along alignment (RI-7)

### Informal criteria

1. Check if the signals are facing opposite direction.
2. Check if the signals are placed on the correct side of the railway.
3. (RI-15) The start station of the alignment is *-153.1 m*
4. (RI-16) Check that the distance between one reference marker and the next one is 50 m, except for the first one
