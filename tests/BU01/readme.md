## Intent

This Test belongs to a series of Tests that share a dataset from the same project as a business case. 
The series of tests that belong to this Business Case are listed as follows:

| Test code | Test name     | 
|-----------|-----------------|
| PS01      | Project setup with georeferencing |
| TE01      | Terrain as existing condition model |
| AL01      | Multiple alignments of railway line |
| LD01      | Loading gauge|
| TR01      | Track panels positioned along alignments |
| **BU01**  | **Building(s) as existing condition model** |
| BU02      | Building positioned along alignment |
| MF01      | Model federation|


## IFC concepts involved in this test

- All listed in [TE01](https://github.com/buildingSMART/IFC4.x-IF/tree/main/tests/TE01#ifc-concepts-involved-in-this-test)
- [Body Geometry](https://ifc43-docs.standards.buildingsmart.org/IFC/RELEASE/IFC4x3/HTML/concepts/Product_Shape/Product_Geometric_Representation/Body_Geometry/content.html)


## Prerequisites

The test plan builds upon the [TE01 test plan](../TE01/Readme.md).


## Test dataset (input)

This test case utilises the dataset collected in the Dataset folder and summarised in the table below. **For more details on each item see [Dataset description](Dataset/README.md).**

| Filename (format)         | Description                                                        |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BC001_BU01_reference.ifc  | **Reference IFC file**. Contains an exemplary export for this test.|


## Validation criteria

:zap: For this test case to be considered passed, **all criteria listed in this section**, and **the ones of prerequisites tests** shall be verified. :zap:

### Formal rules

#### IFC standard (schema and specification)

When validated using the bSI Validation Service, the IFC must pass:

- Syntax & Schema check
- Following rules:
    - [SPS002 - Correct spatial breakdown](https://github.com/buildingSMART/ifc-gherkin-rules/pull/65) ðŸš§


#### Test case-specific checks

[IDS file BU01.ids](./Dataset/BU01.ids):

- (RI-80) The `IfcBuilding` instances shall be aggregated in `IfcSite`.

Not covered by the IDS file (must be checked otherwise):

- (RI-71) The `IfcBuilding` instances shall have no `IfcElement` contained.
- (RI-71) The `IfcBuilding` instances shall have no `IfcSpatialElement` aggregates.
- (RI-71) The `IfcBuilding` instances shall have `'Body'` representation.

### Informal criteria

- All buildings should lie almost completely inside the terrain, overspanning a bit on the North, East and South side.

### Expected geometry

See [above](#informal-criteria).



### Control parameters

The following steps should be performed in order to corroborate that the software is working as expected.

After importing the reference file (`BC001_BU01_reference.ifc`):

- There are 47 `IfcBuilding`s in the file.
