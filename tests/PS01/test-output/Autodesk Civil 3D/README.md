This folder contains the IFC files produced by Autodesk Civil 3D software for test case PS01.
It contains a Civil 3D DWG file with coordinate system assigned and configuration file (.json) used for export.

Note: the IFC export in Civil 3D can be configured or controlled by the json file (the exporter will recognize the file adjacent to the dwg).
