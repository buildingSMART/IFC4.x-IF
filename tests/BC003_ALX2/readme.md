## Prerequisites

The test plan builds upon the previous test plans. All requirements presented in previous test plans must be met.

## Test dataset (input)

This test case utilises the dataset collected in the Dataset folder and is summarised in the table below. **For more details on each item see [Dataset description](Dataset/README.md).**

| Filename (format)                   | Description                                                        |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BC003_ALX2_reference.ifc  | **Reference IFC file.** Contains an exemplary export for this test. Please, note that this IFC file was created using the existing capabilities of Civil 3D, which means that the file is not 100% compliant with the test requirements.|
| BC003_ALX2_Inspection_chambers.dwg | **Native file.** It’s an Autodesk Civil 3D 2023 file containing manhole and inspection chamber information. |
| BC003_ALX2_Cabling_alignments.dwg  | **Native file.** It’s an Autodesk Civil 3D 2023 file containing the cabling infrastructure alignments that creates the infrastructure networks connecting the different manholes/junction boxes. |
| BC003_ALX2_Cabling_alignments.xml  | **The exported LandXML format** from the native alignment file containing the same 7 alignments. |

In addition, the outcome of the previous tests shall be used as input of this test.

## Validation criteria

:zap: For this test case to be considered passed, **all criteria listed in this section**, and **the ones of prerequisites tests** shall be verified. :zap:

### Formal rules

#### IFC standard (schema and specification)

When validated using the bSI Validation Service, the IFC must pass:

- Syntax & Schema check


#### Test case-specific checks

[IDS file BC003_ALX2.ids](./Dataset/BC003_ALX2.ids):

- There must be 1 instance of `IfcProject` and must be named `BC003: Test plan 1`;
- Alignments must have the same Name and Length as those one found in the `BC003_AL01_Reference` file, which means:

| Name              |  Length (m)  |
|-------------------|--------------|
| SAN1_XD-B02       | 1709.845     |
| SAN1_XG-B02       | 1693.042     |
| SAN1_COM          |   40.179     |
| SAN1_XG-3eme_Voie |  104.421     |

- Cabling infrastructure alignments must have the Name and Length according to the table below:

| Name              |  Length (m)  |
|-------------------|--------------|
| A1                | 108.361      |
| A2                |  14.567      |
| A3                |  47.350      |
| A4                |  14.579      |
| A5                |  58.982      |
| A6                |  39.725      |
| A7                |   9.190      |

- All `IfcDistributionChamberElement` must use the predefined type `INSPECTIONCHAMBER`.

#### Not covered by the IDS file (must be checked otherwise)

- Inspection chambers are placed in the model using coordinates (XYZ). Once placed, **railway alignment station** is used to **locate** then for works and maintenance purposes. So, Inspection Chambers shall **correlate their XYZ placement and a station in the railway alignment**. In some cases, there isn’t a railway alignment near the inspection chamber, so the cabling infrastructure alignment shall be used as reference. The table below presents for each inspection chamber, its referenced alignment, the referenced station and its placement coordinates of the top center point:

| Name              | Ref. Alignment    |  Station   |  Coord. XYZ (top center point)  |
