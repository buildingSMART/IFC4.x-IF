## Validation criteria

:zap: For this test case to be considered passed, **all criteria listed in this section**, and **the ones of prerequisites tests** shall be verified. :zap:

### Formal rules

#### IFC standard (schema and specification)

When validated using the bSI Validation Service, the IFC must pass:
- Syntax & Schema check
- All following rules:
  - ALB002 - Alignment layout (RI-6)
  - ALB003 - Alignment directions
  - TBD000 - Alignment shape representation (RI-5, RI-9, RI-10, RI-12, RI-14)
  - TBD000 - Stationing along alignment (RI-7)

#### Test case-specific checks

Covered by this IDS file: [STN02.ids](./Dataset/STN02.ids)

- (RI-18) Each IfcProduct (and subtypes) must have the attribute `Name` not null and not empty
- (RI-4) An IfcProject must have the attribute `Description` not null and not empty
- There must be 1 instance(s) of IfcAlignment and must be named `Track alignment`,its PredefinedType must be `USERDEFINED` and its ObjectType must be `Railway track alignment`
- There must be 1 instance(s) of IfcAlignmentHorizontal and must be named `H1`
- There must be 1 instance(s) of IfcAlignmentVertical and must be named `V1`
- There must be 1 instance(s) of IfcAlignmentCant and must be named `C1`
